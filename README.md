# webApi

This is a project whose main purpose is educational. The objective as such is to enhance, enrich as well as sharpen my personal skill set in all things concerning Software Development.
That means it will most likely never end, it will be over engineered and it will aim for the stars.
So far it includes: 
Hard parts: Web API, WCF, Entity Frame work, Swagger, SQL, Git
Softish parts: Architecture i.e. design, refactoring, REST(ful), IDE and tooling, GitHub

Todo:
Make API reflect new many to many relationship
  Refactor User and Sub controllers top pure CRUD
  Add admin controller for subscribe, unsubscribe
